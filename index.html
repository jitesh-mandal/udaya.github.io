                <h1>A Letter To You!</h1>
                <p>
                    It's almost been a year since when we have been in contact with each other.
                    <br>
                    I don't know the exact thing which made me attacted towards you but the few things including the way of your talking, the heart melting voice and your friendly nature are something which I consider most and take as the reason.
                    <br>
                    I want to say thanks to those movemenets for those lovely time spent with you.
                    <br>
                    There is no day where hadn't fight atleast a single time. <br>
                    But Why????
                    <br>
                    A fight usually makes two people go far from each other. <br>
                    But why in our case it mean opposite? <br>
                    Why fights made use go even more closer? <br>

                    I don't know anything but I am mad about you! <br>

                    Where you are always ruling my thoughts, my dreams and everything. <br>

                    You are the one who is controlling my heart beat level. <br>
                    Where it starts beat faster if I don't get you for any reason. <br>

                    You are the one who owns my heart, my thoughts, my dreams, me and my everything belonging to me.
                    <br>
                    It's my dream to spend my entire life with you. Where I just want to feel the presence of  you. Where I want to end my life just staring at you whole life, and talking to you in what I make you laugh, even cry and to get on sulk on me even for little things.
                    <br>
                    Yeah I don't know anything but I am mad about you. <br>

                    It is just you who is.. <br>
                    My desire, <br>
                    My goal, <br>
                    My angel, <br>
                    my U, <br>
                    My Udaya, <br>
                    My Baby, <br>
                    My Sweety and my Cutie. <br>

                    I don't want anything else apart from you. <br>
                    I don't want that life whre I don't get you. <br>

                    Babyy... I Love Youuu! <br>

                    Where are you??? <br>
                    Why I am missing you a  lot??? <br>
